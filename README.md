- Switch to Master branch
- My Laptop's memory was full and all my submissions were already uploaded on Github and LMS so I deleted them however I still tired to clone and organize to this repository I was unable to do so entirely.
- I am unable to clone Lab 4 and 5 however they are working and are uploaded on the DE repository I forked ( My group number is 32)
- Rest are LMS based submissions which are present on LMS
- Lab 6 (Deploying ML app unto hugging face was in class submission) I was unable to come to come that day so I have uploaded that before due time on LMS too ( I have spoken with Uzair on this regards)
